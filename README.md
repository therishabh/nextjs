### **React vs. Next.js**  

#### **React**  
- A **JavaScript library** for building dynamic and reusable user interfaces.  
- Focuses solely on the **view layer** (UI components).  
- Requires additional configurations for routing, data fetching, and SSR/SSG.  
- Ideal for **SPAs (Single-Page Applications)** where SEO is not a priority.  

#### **Next.js**  
- A **production-ready framework** built on top of React.  
- Extends React with powerful features like:  
  - Built-in **file-based routing**  
  - **Server-Side Rendering (SSR)** & **Static Site Generation (SSG)**  
  - API routes (**backend endpoints** within the same project)  
  - Automatic **code splitting** & **optimized performance**  
- Simplifies deployment with **zero-config optimizations** (image, font, script loading).  
- Perfect for **SEO-friendly websites, e-commerce, dashboards, and full-stack apps**.  

**Key Takeaway:**  
- Use **React** when you need full control over configurations.  
- Use **Next.js** when you want a **batteries-included** solution for fast, scalable, and SEO-optimized apps.
